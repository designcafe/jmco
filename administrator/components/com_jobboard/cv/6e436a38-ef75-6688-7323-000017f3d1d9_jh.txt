This was a billing cooperation that handled about 36 hospitals that their claims have been denied  for no authorizations, pre existing conditions, not medical necessary, and contractual underpayments. I would write appeals  and contact primary care physicians to help obtain authorizations in order to get the claims paid when necessary. I have also dealt with a little Medicaid and Medicare.
